## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm (v6.0.0 or later)
- [Your database system, e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL]

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-management-app.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both client and server:
   ```
   cd employee-management-app
   npm run install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - In the `client` directory, create a `.env` file with:
     ```
     VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
     ```
   - In the `server` directory, create a `.env` file with:
     ```
     PORT=3000
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
     ```

4. [Add any additional setup steps, like database initialization]

## Running the Application

To run both the client and server concurrently:

```
npm start
```

This will start the backend server on `http://localhost:3000` and the frontend on `http://localhost:5173`.

To run only the backend:

```
npm run server
```

To run only the frontend:

```
npm run client
```

## Testing

To run tests for both client and server:

```
npm test
```

To run tests for only the client:

```
cd client && npm test
```

To run tests for only the server:

```
cd server && npm test
```
